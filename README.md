# Password-cracking-report
## Purpose: 
Document a controlled, authorized assessment of password hashes using dictionary and brute-force techniques (Hashcat, John the Ripper) for the purposes of testing password policy strength and informing remediation

## Objective: Evaluate password strength of provided hashes using dictionary, rule-based, mask, and brute-force approaches.

## Tools: Hashcat, John the Ripper (Jumbo recommended), Kali Linux or a suitably provisioned Linux system, wordlists (e.g., wordlist.txt).
# Attack Strategy
1. Load the hash file into your cracking tool.
2. Load the wordlist with candidate passwords.
3. Run a dictionary attack.
4. Record cracked hashes and compare to the expected plaintext.
